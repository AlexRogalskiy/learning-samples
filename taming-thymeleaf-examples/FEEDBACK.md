# Feedback for Wim I
+ short and precise quickstart example for Spring Boot newbies
+ Great to start early with nice css

- adjust explanation of beans and components and what CI is
- maybe quick template HTML to code in parallel a little earlier, and explain what the `th` is
- idea (to server side render newbies): high level picture how the processing  (template + input -> final HTML -> browser)
- Webpack instead of Gulp?
- Maybe move NPM installation to a central setup chapter?
- The Frontend Maven Build Config in pom.xml is hard to copy. Maybe split it and maybe spaces instead of tabs to fit it to the screen
- Mixing npm with npx (maybe quick explanation what npx is)
- Trying to get the Tailwind Application Shell: https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/application-shells/sidebar redirects me to their pricing
- Copying the whole template index.html (as I couldn't access Tailwind without paying them) is a little tedious. Maybe reduce the initial template and add stuff step-by-step

+ great refactoring effort and introduction to fragments
+ full file name on top of each code example is extremely helpful

- after JS refactoring part: Uncaught (in promise) ReferenceError: sidebarMenu is not defined (code examples lack the function sidebarMenu -> plain copy and paste failed)
