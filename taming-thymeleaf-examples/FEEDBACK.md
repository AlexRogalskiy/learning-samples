# Feedback for Wim

- adjust explanation of beans and components and what CI is
- short and precise quickstart example for Spring Boot newbies
- maybe quick template HTML to code in parallel a little bit eariler, and explain what the `th` is
- idea (to server side render newbies): high level picture how the processing  (template + input -> final HTML -> browser)
- Webpack instead of Gulp?
- Great to start early with nice css
- Maybe move NPM installation to a central setup chapter?
- The Frontend Maven Build Config in pom.xml is a little bit hard to copy. Maybe split it and maybe spaces instead of tabs to fit it to the screen
- Mixing npm with npx (maybe quick explanation what npx is)
- Trying to get the Tailwind Application Shell: https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/application-shells/sidebar redirects me to their pricing
- Copying the whole template index.html (as I couldn't access Tailwind without paying them) is a little bit tedious. Maybe reduce the initial template and add stuff step-by-step
